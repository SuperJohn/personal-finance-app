You can use the **Financials** tab on the **Portfolio Overview** page to view range of 
information on the financial status of a property, service area, or the entire portfolio. 
The page is separated into a *performance overview* section, and a map to explore the data 
by location.

### Status Cards
----------------
<img src='images/help/financial-cards.png' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' alt = 'Financial Status Cards'/>

Status cards provide a quick point of reference on a property/service area. There are
4 individual cards available:
  * **YTD - BUDGETED**: provides the total, year-to-date, budgeted amount.
  * **YTD - ACTUAL**: provides the total, year-to-date, actual amount.
  * **YTD - VARIANCE**: provides the variance (actual - budgeted).
  * **ADJUSTED VARIANCE**: the adjusted variance takes into account any reported 
  explainable expenses. The presence of explainable variance will decrease negative variance 
  if a property/service area has overspent (negative variance will decrease), but will 
  increase positive variance if a property/service area has underspent (positive variance will increase).

#### Breaking down variance
---------------------------
Both the **YTD-VARIANCE** and the **ADJUSTED VARIANCE** cards can be clicked to reveal
additional information.

##### **YTD-VARIANCE**: the YTD - VARIANCE window will provide the following:

* A breakdown of variance by service area / property. This bar graph (sample shown below) charts
all service areas (if portfolio overview is selected) or properties within a service area (if a service 
area is selected) and sorts them by the total variance (from largest negative variance to largest positive variance). Red
denotes negative variance, while green denotes positive variance. Variance totals and property names are hidden in this 
user guide, but will be populated in the actual chart.

<br />
<br />
* A searchable and expandable table that breaks down the variance by cost center and account. This table has a few functions worth 
noting:
  * **Sorting**: the table can be sorted by any of the columns present.
  * **Searching**: the search box on the upper right-hand corner can be used to search the table across all 
  columns.
  * **INFO**: the INFO column provides additional information about a specific account, if available. Click on the 
  (+) button to view additional information. Rows with no (+) button will not have any additional information.
  * **Charting**: clicking on any row within the table will change the view in the chart above to show only variances 
  within the specific cost center/account selected.

<br />  
* A download box that allows users to download financial information using a variety of options:
  * **Timeframe type**: *Year-To-Date* will download values aggregated to Year-To-Date, whereas *By Month* will 
  provide an export with data aggregated by month, for each month of the current year.
  * **Breakdown by Property**: whether the export should be grouped by property, or portfolio/service area-wide.
  * **Beginning and Ending Months**: If *By Month* is selected, users can select the timeframe of the export, from the 
  beginning of the year (Jan), to the end of the year (or the most recent month of data available).

<br />

##### **ADJUSTED VARIANCE**: the ADJUSTED VARIANCE window will provide the following:

  * A breakdown of year-to-date explainable variance by service area / property. This bar graph charts 
  all service areas (if portfolio overview is selected) or properties within a service area (if a service 
  area is selected) and their respective reported explainable variance. This chart will only be available if 
  explainable variance was reported.
  
  * A table breaking down the explainable variance by location, cost center, account, and date.
