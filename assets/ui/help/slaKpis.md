The **SLA KPIs** tab provides quick information on the various quality measurements 
related to SLA. That tab includes survey ratings from both project managers (PM),
as well as clients (DA). 

### Status Cards
----------------
<img src='images/help/slakpis-cards.png' class='img-responsive img-thumbnail' alt = 'SLA Status Cards'/>

Status cards for **Janitorial**, **Landscape**, **Pest Control**, and **Response Time** 
give a year-to-date measurement on a scale of 1 to 5. Cards can be green (meets SLA, 
score >= 3), or red (does not meet SLA, score < 3). 

In addition, both the **Janitorial** and **Landscape** cards can provide additional 
information when clicked.

<br />

#### Janitorial
The Janitorial score is calculated as an average of 7 measures: dust, floors, 
windows, walls, rest rooms, exam rooms, and lobby. The Janitorial pop up window
will show the individual scores for each section, as well as the overall Janitorial 
score by either service area or property. A score below 3 will be highlighted red, 
while a score at or above 3 will be highlighted green.

*The quality and availability of this data is dependent on each property and their 
reporting frequency. Some properties/service areas may not have data across different months. 
For those properties/service areas, an empty table cell will indicate missing reports.*

#### Landscape
The Landscape score is calculated as an average of 6 measures: hazards, 
lawn & shrubs, planters, irrigation system, trees, and cleanliness. Similar to the 
Janitorial pop up window, the Landscape window will show individual scores for each
section, as well as the overall Landscape score by etiher service area or property.

### Reporting Status
--------------------
A fifth card (PM or DA Reporting) provides a quick count of how many properties have 
submitted at least one survey/report year-to-date. Clicking on that card will open 
a window that will provide additional information on which individual properties 
have submitted a report, and for which month. Some properties may have completed surveys/reports
for all months year-to-date, while others may report intermittently.
